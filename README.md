# T3BA - Example Extension

A commented, example extension for the [TYPO3 - Better Api extension](https://github.com/labor-digital/typo3-better-api).

## Requirements

- TYPO3 v10
- Installation using Composer

## Installation

Install this package using Composer:

```
composer require labor-digital/typo3-better-api-example
```

## Whats included

Most of the extension is designed to be really bare-bones, delivering only the code to show off the features of the T3BA package without obfuscating it by fancy
project based code.

The package comes with a simple site and database setup included, so I would suggest, to install the extension on a clean TYPO3 instance.

The extension provides a simple news system and blog list on a separate landingpage/site setup.
